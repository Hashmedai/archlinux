# Archlinux

My archlinux stuff.


## etc
__etc__ folder contains some system wide configurations.
```etc/profile``` export most systemd wide needed variables.


## home
__home__ folder contains some per user configurations

```home/systemd_user_units``` contains per user systemd service files.


As possible, most of configuration files use the **$XDG_HOME_DIR** ```(~/.config)```
as home folder. 


###X environment

- window manager: i3
- file manager: ranger + PCmanFM
- theme: started with mate-settings-daemon service file
- mount: udisk2
